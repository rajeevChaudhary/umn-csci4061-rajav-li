To compile, type 'make' in the source directory. main_mm.c and main_malloc.c are required to be in the source directory.

To use the program from the shell, type './binary_name' in the source directory after compiling, where binary_name is one of:
	packet_public
	main_mm
	main_malloc

This program demonstrates the memory manager we have implemented in mm_public, both by direct timing and by using a simple packet-receiving model. Details of the memory manager can be found in mm_public.c
