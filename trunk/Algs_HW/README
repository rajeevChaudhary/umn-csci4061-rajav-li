To compile this program, do `ant' from the top-level directory (the one containing src/).

To run it, do `java -jar bin/apsp.jar <Path to graph file> <Number of vertices>' from the top-level directory (the one containing src/ and bin/) after compiling. The output will be written to the directory output/ relative to the directory the command is run from.

This program reads in the directed, weighted graph given in adjacency list format, runs Johnson's algorithm on the graph to determine the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and writes the results to finalAPSP.txt (the matrix of distances of each shortest path) and pathAPSP.txt (the predecessor matrix) in the output directory.

The input graph file should have one adjacency list on each line, with the line number corresponding to the index of the vertex. Each list should alternate adjacent vertex indices and edge weights, with each entry separated by a comma (,). For instance, if a graph has edges (2, 5) and (2, 1) with weights -4 and 1 respectively, line 2 of the graph file could be:

5,-4,1,1
